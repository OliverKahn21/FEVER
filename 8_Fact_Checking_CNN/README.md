# 8.Propose ways to improve the machine learning models you have implemented.

You can either propose new machine learning models, new ways of sampling/using the training data, or propose new neural architectures. You are allowed to use existing libraries/packages for this part. Explain how your proposed method(s) differ from existing work in the literature. The marks you get will be based on the quality and novelty of your proposed methods, as well as the performance of your final model.
